# KARMA-LiveBOT

## Overview

KARMA-LiveBOT is a fully functional Discord bot that monitors and notifies about live streams across multiple platforms (Twitch, YouTube, and TikTok). The bot differentiates between two types of streamers - "Karma Streamers" (premium tier with enhanced cyberpunk-style notifications and daily streak tracking) and "Regular Streamers" (standard simple notifications). The bot operates entirely within Discord with no external dashboard, using different monitoring frequencies and notification styles based on streamer tier.

**Status**: âœ… **FULLY OPERATIONAL** - Bot is running and connected to Discord with Auto-Deletion Test feature and Instant Gaming Integration
**Last Updated**: September 28, 2025 - Fresh GitHub import configured for Replit

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Bot Framework
- **Discord.py**: Core bot framework using `discord.ext.commands` for command handling and slash commands
- **SQLite Database**: Local data persistence for creator configurations, stream tracking, and daily streaks
- **Asynchronous Operations**: Built on asyncio for concurrent stream monitoring and Discord interactions

### Command Structure
- **Slash Commands**: Modern Discord application commands using `app_commands` (12 commands total)
  - Admin Commands: `/addcreator`, `/deletecreator`, `/streakevent`, `/reset`, `/testbot`
  - User Commands: `/request`, `/requeststatus`, `/subcreator`, `/unsub`, `/live`, `/ranking`, `/help`
  - Developer Commands: `/serverinfo` (with Auto-Deletion Test feature)
- **Role-Based Permissions**: 
  - Admin commands require admin roles (IDs: 1388945013735424020, 581139700408909864, 898970074491269170)
  - User commands require user role (ID: 292321283608150016)
- **Modular Cog System**: Separate command modules (`commands.py`, `event_commands.py`) for different functionalities
- **Interactive UI**: Modal forms and dropdown selects for complex configuration

### Stream Monitoring Architecture
- **Tiered Monitoring**: Different check intervals based on streamer type
  - Karma Streamers: Every 1 minute
  - Regular Streamers: Every 3 minutes
- **Platform-Specific APIs**:
  - Twitch: Official Twitch API with OAuth2 authentication
  - YouTube: Smart Polling System - Web scraping for live detection, API only for details (95% quota reduction)
  - TikTok: Universal JSON pattern analysis with â‰¥2 pattern threshold (eliminates false positives)
- **Smart Polling (YouTube)**: Two-phase approach to optimize API quota usage
  - Phase 1: Web scraping for basic live detection (free)
  - Phase 2: YouTube API calls only when live detected (expensive but necessary)
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Daily tracking system prevents multiple notifications for the same stream session

### Notification System
- **Tiered Notification Styles**: 
  - Karma Streamers: Cyberpunk-style notifications with emojis (ðŸš¨ Hey Cyber-Runner! ðŸš¨)
  - Regular Streamers: Simple notifications (ðŸ‘¾ [User] ist LIVE!)
- **Embed-Based Messages**: Rich Discord embeds with platform-specific colors
  - Twitch: Purple (0x9146FF), YouTube: Red (0xFF0000), TikTok: Light Blue (0x00F2EA)
- **Dynamic Content**: Real-time viewer counts, game/category information, stream thumbnails, follower/subscriber counts
- **Follower/Subscriber Display**: All platforms show follower counts (Twitch followers, YouTube subscribers, TikTok followers)
- **Different Embed Contents**: Karma gets profile images + daily streaks, Regular gets basic info
- **Interactive Elements**: Follow buttons linking to platform profiles, **Instant Gaming affiliate purchase buttons**
- **Role Management**: Automatic assignment/removal of live roles when streamers go online/offline
- **Personal Subscriptions**: Private DM notifications for subscribed users
- **ðŸŽ® Instant Gaming Integration**: Automatic game detection and affiliate purchase buttons with tag "tikzzay"

### Data Model
- **Creator Profiles**: Discord user mapping to platform accounts (Twitch, YouTube, TikTok)
- **Stream Sessions**: Tracking of daily streams to prevent duplicate notifications
- **Dual Streak System**: 
  - Daily Streaks: Only for Karma Streamers (persistent tracking)
  - Event Streaks: For both types during active events (with point multipliers)
- **Event System**: Points based on stream duration + streak multipliers
- **User Subscriptions**: Personal notification preferences per creator
- **Channel Configuration**: Per-creator notification channel assignments
- **Live Status Tracking**: Per-platform live status to prevent duplicate notifications

### Authentication & Permissions
- **Discord Permissions**: Role-based access control using specific Discord role IDs
- **Admin Commands**: Restricted to admin roles (IDs: 1388945013735424020, 581139700408909864, 898970074491269170)
- **User Commands**: Require user role (ID: 292321283608150016) for normal user access
- **API Authentication**: Environment variable-based API key management
- **Secure Token Handling**: OAuth2 flows for platform API access
